Amazon Sales Performance

📊 Sales Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project

Excited to share my latest project built using Power BI, where I created an interactive Sales Dashboard to visualize product performance, customer locations, and order status across the U.S.

🔍 Dashboard Highlights:

📦 Total Sales tracked across 714 orders, totaling 244K units

🛍️ Product-level analysis: Quantity & Revenue breakdown by category (e.g. Smartphone, Laptop, Refrigerator)

🌍 Customer Geo-Location visualized using map visuals by city (Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, etc.)

💳 Order segmentation by Status (Completed, Pending, Cancelled) and Payment Method

📈 Used bar charts, pie charts, slicers, and dynamic filters for clear insights

🧮 DAX Measures and Power Query used for KPIs like total smartwatch sales, quantity sold, and revenue share

🎯 Goal: Empower businesses to track product performance and identify top-selling regions, optimize inventory, and monitor fulfillment status in real time.

Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Excel
